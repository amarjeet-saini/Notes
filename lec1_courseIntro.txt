***** TOPICS ******

  1. System
  2. Embedded 
  3. Real-Time
    a. Response Time
    b. Failed System

***** NOTES ******

1. System
  *      input    -> SYSTEM ->   output
   (exicatation)              (actuation)
  *  degree of performance
  *  purpose

2. Embedded
  * computing system for dedicated set 
  * part of a larger system

3. Real-Time
  * system has both correctness and time constraints, if failed can have consequences
  
  Response Time: time between excitation of input(i.e input is received at pin) till 
              actuation/activation of a necessary task
