****** TOPICS ********
  1. Real Time Systems - Soft, Hard, Firm
  2. Deadline, Punctuality, Events
  3. CPU Utilization

****** NOTES ********

1. RT - soft, hard, firm
   system misses deadline based on consequences differentiaite
   hard_rt: single deadline miss severe consequences
   firm_rt: can miss one or more deadline but not too many
   soft_rt: missing deadline leads to perfomance degradation

2. Deadline 
        : Hard deadline - safety envolved
        : Performance deadline - performance degrade


3. Punctuality
   Response time ≠ constant in RT, can be variable 
   eg: draw two gaussian curve: more variance, less punctual

4. Events
    any occurence which changes flow of control (i.e sequential behaviour of program)
   Release Time
    time when a task is ready to run
    eg:
        

5. Deterministic system: event vs temporal determinism

6. CPU Utilization:
  usage of cpu processing resources by an application
  U = Σ (ei/pi) where ei: execution time, pi: execution period
